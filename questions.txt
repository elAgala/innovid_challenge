1. Even though the API was not so difficult to implement, I spent a while planning the best
way to make the code as readable as possible.

2. The Node.js API took me nearly an hour and the Vue.js client almost half an hour.

3. Maybe I would have tried to show not just the daily forecast but also the hourly. Another
good idea would be if you could select a specific date with a date-picker and search the 
forecast of it.

4. I could use Unit Testing for both server and client side using some tools as Jest or Mocha.Some of the tests could be:
	- Searching for an unsupported city responds with an error.
	- Searching for a supported city responds with the daily forecast.
	- If forecastdays is not on the 1-3 range, throws an error.
	- If city is an empty string or forescastdays is not defined, throws an error.
